# DVS Mentorship Summer 2024
I became a mentor for the Data Visualization Society (DVS) mentorship program in summer 2024. I have two mentees who are interested in different parts of data visualization. This repository contains all the code I prepared for the mentorship sessions.

I taught both mentees the basic of SVG and D3.js. One mentee is more interested in learning more about D3.js, and I wrote a few HTML files to help him learn D3.js. The other mentee is interested in D3 + Svelte, and the folder is a simple SvelteKit data viz project I created.

I post the code here for future references, and I might use them again for the future mentorships.
