# DVS Mentorship

## 2024
I became a mentor for the Data Visualization Society (DVS) mentorship program in summer 2024. I have two mentees who are interested in different parts of data visualization. The "2024" folder contains all the code I prepared for the mentorship sessions.

I taught both mentees the basic of SVG and D3.js. One mentee is more interested in learning more about D3.js, and I wrote a few HTML files to help him learn D3.js. The other mentee is interested in D3 + Svelte, and the folder "D3 + Svelte" is a simple SvelteKit data visualization project I created.

I post the code here for future references, and I might use them again for the future mentorship sessions.

## 2025
I became a mentor of the DVS mentorship again in 2025. The "2025" folder contains all the code I prepared for the mentorship sessions. This time, I have one mentee who has little experience in JavaScript. The mentorship starts with sessions about basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the first three weeks. Week 4 and 5 are about basic SVGs.
